# MultiThreadedCrawler
MultiThreadCrawler is a lightweight, multithreaded web crawler designed to fetch and parse web pages efficiently.
It uses multiple threads to crawl URLs concurrently, improving speed and performance compared to single-threaded crawlers.

## Features
 Multithreaded architecture for faster crawling
 Fetches multiple web pages concurrently
 Parses and extracts links/text from pages
 Avoids duplicate crawling using visited-URL tracking
 Configurable thread count and depth limit

 ## Tech Stack
Language: Java / Python / Node.js (specify your actual language)
Libraries/Tools Used:
(e.g., requests, BeautifulSoup, concurrent.futures in Python)
(or java.net.HttpURLConnection, ExecutorService in Java)
